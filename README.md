# About
Kirameki API, short **kirAPI**, is the backend media API for Kirameki serving all dynamically required media elements from third parties. Outsourcing Kirameki's media requirements to a blazing fast Go server has proven to reduce loadtimes drastically during demanding access peaks. As of now this API is solely serving media assets *but is capable of running Node.js workers for unlimited possibilities.*
