# About
Kirameki API, short **kirAPI**, is the backend media API for Kirameki serving all dynamically required media elements from third parties. Outsourcing Kirameki's media requirements to a blazing fast Go server has proven to reduce loadtimes drastically during demanding access peaks. As of now this API is solely serving media assets *but is capable of running Node.js workers for unlimited possibilities.* Right now this API isn't used in producion actively until it's been tested further down the road. Using cutting edge and blazing fast web technologies though, this API should be *extremely* capable in serving assets.
